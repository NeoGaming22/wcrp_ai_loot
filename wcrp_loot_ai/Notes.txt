Thanks to Cryptos' loot for the base of this
and A HUGE thanks to Poke for helping me out!
the skinning is baised on Juan_Hunting cfg layout since a lot of the work has already been done.

this will not work with Juan_Hunting by default




Changes
	Fixed typo in addXP, now gives XP per loot
	started support for skinning animals
	started support for picking up small "Critter" like carcuss
	started support for Plucking (SKINNING) birds.
	Item Loot table so you can loot random things from the npc's -- just add the items in the nil place
	RDO style looting prompts
	Fixed skinable = false (overkilled them while trying to keep cheatting down)
	Fixed Double SQl entry 
	Added Carcass after skinning is completed. (Carcass stick around for about 20 sec each , so not to overload Server with bodies)
